# Rust <-> Julia interface

While I have grown to appreciate the differences in applications for these 2
languages, these are not mutually exclusive and many times the stack or pipeline
of components that compose one application might cross language boundaries.

These might be because one language has much better support, usually in terms of
libraries available, but also in robustness a complex library.

While these 2 language are not truly compatible, some tricks can be added to
ease translation, especially when it comes to the generics `Option` and `Result`
in Rust. There are alternatives for these in Julia, even though by default Julia
does not come equipped with the same paradigm:

- [ResultTypes.jl](https://github.com/0x0f0f0f/ResultTypes.jl)
- `Option` is generally used as `Union{T, Nothing}` in Julia


## Rust ABI 

There is currently no agreed way even for calling dylib Rust <-> Rust, known as
an ABI, this is because the arguments are not assured to have any layout in
memory, they are decided arbitrarily when compiled:

[rust abi_stable crate](https://lib.rs/crates/abi_stable) ðŸ¤£:
> the compiler is free to do whatever it pleases with these aspects of your
> software: the process by which it does that is explicitly unstable, and
> depends on your compiler version, the optimization level you selected, some
> llama's mood in a wool farm near Berkshire... who knows?

### Standard strategy: `extern "C"`

The standard way to call Rust through a FFI is translating it into to expose a C
interface and reuse the system C-ABI. This however causes to drop many of the
guarantees Rust tries to make and induces a huge effort boundary of developing
software that empowers these two languages to talk, since the translation effort
is required two folds as boilerplate glueing code that doesn't add any
value.

## Interim solution to ease integration

=> Develop `RustCall.jl` library similar to `PyCall.jl` which can use cargo
packager to build Rust pacakge and generate the necessary C-FFI shims for the
two sides as follows:

1. Construct a SAT of the public interface of the Rust library
2.
